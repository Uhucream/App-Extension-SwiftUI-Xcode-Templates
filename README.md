# App-Extension-SwiftUI-Xcode-Templates
Xcode templates for App Extension with SwiftUI 

By using these templates, you can add App Extensions that require to create views with `MainInterface.storybobard` such as Photo Editing Extension to your project without `MainInterface.storyboard` and you can create their views using only SwiftUI.
